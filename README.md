# Specialisterne Blackjack

The project for the first official week at Specialisterne Academy, a small blackjack game that consists of specific house-rules (dealer's second card is Out-of-the-hole, dealer stands on soft 17, split can be done 'infinitely' as long as the 'hands' have the same card, No surrender, blackjack draws are lost)
